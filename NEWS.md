# nodbi 0.13.0

## Improvements
* Prepare `docdb_query()` for `duckdb` 1.3.0 (e.g., use new `json_tree` function)
* Move warning for non-persistent connections to `src_sqlite`, `src_duckdb` calls
* Harmomise printing connections

# nodbi 0.12.0

## Improvements
* Use `duckdb` internal function for writing NDJSON to file
* Removing message about RSQLite handling NDJSON file name as value

# nodbi 0.11.0

## Potentially breaking changes
* `docdb_query()` modified so that it returns a data frame, in which each column has just one type (atomic or list) across all the rows of the respective column (previously, e.g. a mix of single-item lists simplified to atomic values and of multi-item lists were returned)

## Changes
* `docdb_create()` and `docdb_update()` for SQLite and PostgreSQL (only if on localhost) now import directly and fast from `ndjson` files, in analogy to DuckDB (needs RSQLite >= 2.3.7.9014)
* Refactored `docdb_update()` for `src_couchdb()`
* Add message from `docdb_create()` if a data frame has column names with a dot(s) since dots in `nodbi` are used for `JSON` dot paths
* Add code to check database backend version requirements
* Adding info if PostgreSQL database is not yet created
* Factored out further code

# nodbi 0.10.7

## Changes
* uses new features of `duckdb` 1.11.0 for refactoring of `docdb_query()`, accelerating queries
* accelerated creating and updating from file

# nodbi 0.10.6

## Changes
* partial refactoring of `docdb_query()`, accelerating queries up to 20-fold for SQLite, DuckDB, and accelerating `listfields = TRUE` several times for DuckDB

## Bug fix
* address `docdb_query()` not working for cases when dot paths had no counts between fields
* address wrong database size printing

# nodbi 0.10.5

## Bug fix
* stop if query is invalid even though JSON is valid 
* print information also for MongoDB connection object

## Changes
* code cleaning, parameters checking
* document that `$regex` in `docdb_query()` is case-sensitive

# nodbi 0.10.4

## Bug fix
* re-adding field formatting for `docdb_query(src, key, query, listfields = TRUE, limit = <integer>)`

# nodbi 0.10.3

## Bug fix
* minor fixes to `limit` in `docdb_query(src, key, query, listfields = TRUE, limit = <integer>)` and speed up

# nodbi 0.10.2

## Changes
* added vignette
* added tests internal functions, verbose option
* added caching to GitHub action workflow
* added missing fields validity check for duckdb
* more robust parameter checks in `docdb_query` and `docdb_update`
* ensure `NULL` also for all MongoDB returns

## Bug fixes
* docTyp'ed src.R
* minify `JSON` with Elasticsearch in `docdb_update`
* moved local variable out of UseMethod in `docdb_query`

# nodbi 0.10.1

## Bug fix
* make `docdb_get()` work again for `src_sqlite()` by casting `JSONB` back to `JSON`

# nodbi 0.10.0

## Deprecated
* empty parameter `query` now triggers a warning as it should be a valid JSON string; change `query = ""` into `query = "{}"` 

## Changes
* adapted to use new, faster `JSONB` functions in `SQLite` 3.45.0 (`RSQLite` >= 2.3.4.9005)
* refactored parts of `docdb_create()` to speed up handling large data frames and lists
* made Elasticsearch to immediately refresh index after `docdb_create()` and other functions
* `docdb_update()` now reports which records failed to update and then continues
* `docdb_delete()` now returns harmonised success logical value across backends

## Potentially breaking change
`docdb_query()` reimplementation to have the same functionality across all databases (DuckDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, CouchDB); even though the API and unit tests remained, user provisions may break e.g. to handle return values of databases that previously were incompletely implemented (in particular Elasticsearch and CouchDB). Details: 

* `query` can now be complex (nested, various operators) and is digested with a Javascript helper
* `fields` can now be nested fields (e.g., `friends.name`) to directly return values lifted from the nested field 
* `listfields` parameter newly implemented to return dot paths for all fields of all or selected documents in collection 
* expanded use of `jq` via `jqr` for mangling parameters, selecting documents, filtering fields and lifting nested field values
* if no data are found, returns `NULL` (previously some backends returned an empty data frame)
* `docdb_query(src, key, query = "{}", fields = "{}")` now delegates to `docdb_get(src, key)`
* `_id` is always returned, unless specified with `"_id": 0` in parameter `fields`
* for `scr_postgres`, only fewer than 50 fields if any can be specified in `fields`
* for `src_sqlite`, minimise the use of the time-costly `json_tree`
* workaround for path collisions of MongoDB
* some acceleration of `docdb_query()`
* factored out common code 
* expanded testing
* updated docs
